# Eggtracker

Welcome to eggtracker - a great little IOT project to help you keep track of consumables in your kitchen!

This project (intended for mobile) was completed using React, Node, Knex, Express, PostgreSQL. The app has a complementary IoT component that incorporates a Raspberry Pi. The Pi captures images of your egg carton and counts the number of eggs using image processing (Tracking.js). This count is then updated in the database and made available to users for real-time perishable tracking.
