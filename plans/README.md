Welcome to my prototype eggtracker.

As of today, 13-Sep-18, I am embarking on a foolishly difficult capstone project for Galvanize. If you've found it, this is my first machine learning project. I am excited to see where it takes me.

I plan to use TensorFlow to train an algorithm to count how many eggs are present in my refrigerator.

At a glance, this sounds exceedingly boring. Who cares how many eggs are in the fridge?!

It's not about the destination, it is about the journey.

Welcome to a wild ride.
